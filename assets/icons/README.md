# Icons Directory

This directory should contain all icon assets for the MediHelper app.

Suggested icons to include:
- report_icon.png - Icon for medical reports
- analysis_icon.png - Icon for analysis feature
- history_icon.png - Icon for history feature
- profile_icon.png - Icon for user profile

Note: While the app primarily uses Material Icons from Flutter, custom icons can be placed here.
